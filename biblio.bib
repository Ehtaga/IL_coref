The anaphoric expressions selected are mainly grammatical discourse phenomena for which a reliable annotation could be provided. The annotation scheme, defined in XML, encodes the orientation of the anaphoric relation by using a specific element for relating the anaphoric expression to its antecedent(s). A set of five semantic relations is used to type the anaphoric relation. As a rule, linguistic expressions selected are phrases, but the annotation scheme uses specific elements to deal with descriptive anaphors which occur in nominal ellipses and demonstrative anaphors. Special cases such as multiple antecedents, discontinuous elements or ambiguity are discussed.}},

French is the earliest application, but other studies, in varied languages, have also been performed.The major principle is that the unit of meaning is not located at the level of the word, but at the level of elementary sentences; we will see how coherent descriptions of natural languages have been built on this basis.}},
