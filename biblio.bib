    abstract = {{This paper presents a one million word French corpus annotated with anaphoric links. The anaphoric expressions selected are mainly grammatical discourse phenomena for which a reliable annotation could be provided. The annotation scheme, defined in XML, encodes the orientation of the anaphoric relation by using a specific element for relating the anaphoric expression to its antecedent(s). A set of five semantic relations is used to type the anaphoric relation. As a rule, linguistic expressions selected are phrases, but the annotation scheme uses specific elements to deal with descriptive anaphors which occur in nominal ellipses and demonstrative anaphors. Special cases such as multiple antecedents, discontinuous elements or ambiguity are discussed.}},

This paper describes the software system, and the hierarchical semantic tag set containing 21 major discourse fields and 232 fine-grained semantic field tags. We discuss the manually constructed lexical resources on which the system relies, and the seven disambiguation methods including part-of-speech tagging, general likelihood ranking, multi-word-expression extraction, domain of discourse identification, and contextual rules. We report an evaluation of the accuracy of the system compared to a manually tagged test corpus on which the USAS software obtained a precision value of 91\%. Finally, we make reference to the applications of the system in corpus linguistics, content analysis, software engineering, and electronic dictionaries.}},
